You'll see the command being built in the textbox as you hit the buttons. Once your command is built, press Copy to Clipboard (or manually copy) then paste it into Discord amd hit Enter.

For a tie, select one player for 1st, press Add, then use the same 1st place drop-down and Add the other player. If successful, you'll get the proper result: #1 ... #1 ... command for a tie.
